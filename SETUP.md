## Setup Logos

### Step 0: Download Logos.

You can always get the latest release of Logos [here](https://github.com/vxern/logos/releases/latest).

To download the release, simply download your archive of choice (.zip, .tar.gz) under 'Assets', then unzip the files.

### Step 1: Let's start.

To get a minimal instance of Logos up and running, you only need to have [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)
installed.

Before you can start the bot, you will need to create an `.env` file storing your bot's Discord token:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=<token goes here>
```

To start the bot:

```
bun start
```

If everything ran smoothly, you should now have a live Logos instance!

> Note: You are running a minimal instance. A large chunk of Logos' features will be unavailable yet. The rest of the
> setup guide will teach you how to enable (or disable!) each piece of functionality one-by-one.

### Step 2: Configuring the database

> Without configuration, Logos will store its documents in memory, and any documents created during the bot's lifecycle
> will be lost on restart.
>
> If you'd prefer that your data be kept, you will need to configure Logos to use a database.
>
> [*If not, feel free to skip to the next section.*](#step-3-configuring-a-cache-database)

Logos comes with a selection of NoSQL databases to use out of the box, giving you the flexibility of deciding which
solution you're going with.

- <details>
    <summary>MongoDB (<a href="https://mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database">Official Website</a>, <a href="https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/">Setup Guide</a>)</summary>

  To use MongoDB with Logos, add the following credentials to your `.env` file:

    ```
    DATABASE_SOLUTION=mongodb # Tell Logos to use MongoDB as its database driver.  
    # MONGODB_USERNAME=       # (optional for unsecured instances) Username for authorisation.
    # MONGODB_PASSWORD=       # (optional for unsecured instances) Password for authorisation.
    MONGODB_HOST=127.0.0.1    # Address of your MongoDB instance. 
    MONGODB_PORT=27017        # Port your MongoDB instance is operating at. (MongoDB uses 27017 by default)
    MONGODB_DATABASE=logos    # Name of your database. 
    ```
  </details>
- <details>
    <summary>RavenDB (<a href="https://ravendb.net">Official Website</a>, <a href="https://ravendb.net/docs/article-page/6.0/csharp/start/installation/setup-wizard">Setup Guide</a>)</summary>

  To use RavenDB with Logos, add the following credentials to your `.env` file:

    ```
    DATABASE_SOLUTION=ravendb # Tell Logos to use RavenDB as its database driver. 
    RAVENDB_HOST=127.0.0.1    # Address of your RavenDB instance.
    RAVENDB_PORT=8080         # Port your RavenDB instance is operating at. (RavenDB uses 8080 by default)
    RAVENDB_DATABASE=logos    # Name of your database.
    # RAVENDB_SECURE=         # (optional for unsecured instances) Whether to establish a secure connection.
                              # If true, Logos will attempt to read a `.cert.pfx` file from the root directory.  
    ```
  </details>
- <details>
    <summary>CouchDB (<a href="https://couchdb.apache.org">Official Website</a>, <a href="https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/install/index.html">Setup Guide</a>)</summary>

  To use CouchDB with Logos, add the following credentials to your `.env` file:

    ```
    DATABASE_SOLUTION=couchdb # Tell Logos to use CouchDB as its database driver.
    COUCHDB_USERNAME=admin    # Username for authorisation.
    COUCHDB_PASSWORD=password # Password for authorisation.
    COUCHDB_HOST=127.0.0.1    # Address of your CouchDB instance.
    COUCHDB_PORT=5984         # Port your CouchDB instance is operating at. (CouchDB uses 5984 by default)
    COUCHDB_DATABASE=logos    # Name of your database.
    ```
  </details>
- <details>
    <summary>RethinkDB (<a href="https://rethinkdb.com/">Official Website</a>, <a href="https://rethinkdb.com/docs/install/">Setup Guide</a>)</summary>

  To use RethinkDB with Logos, add the following credentials to your `.env` file:

    ```
    DATABASE_SOLUTION=rethinkdb # Tell Logos to use RethinkDB as its database driver.
    # RETHINKDB_USERNAME=       # (optional for unsecured instances) Username for authorisation.
    # RETHINKDB_PASSWORD=       # (optional for unsecured instances) Password for authorisation.
    RETHINKDB_HOST=127.0.0.1    # Address of your RethinkDB instance.
    RETHINKDB_PORT=28015        # Port your RethinkDB instance is operating at. (RethinkDB uses 28015 by default)
    RETHINKDB_DATABASE=logos    # Name of your database.
    ```
  </details>
- <details>
    <summary>In-memory database</summary>

  To tell Logos you're fine with running an in-memory database, add the following record to your `.env` file:

    ```
    DATABASE_SOLUTION=none # Tell Logos to store documents in memory.
    ```

</details>

> Note: Logos follows each database's native storage conventions when storing documents, making it predictable how your
> data will look regardless of the database you choose to go with.

### Step 3: Configuring a volatile database

> The `/game` command needs sentence pairs to operate. Sentence pairs are loaded onto and stored in a volatile,
> Redis-compatible database.
>
> If you'd like to support the `/game` command, you will need to configure a volatile database for sentence pairs.
>
> [*If not, feel free to skip to the next section.*](#step-4-configuring-the-audio-node)

Logos will work with any Redis-compatible database, whether that's Redis itself, Dragonfly, KeyDB, or something else.
The choice is up to you.

Regardless of your choice, the credentials to add to `.env` for all of these databases are as follows:

```
REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1 # Address of your database instance. 
REDIS_PORT=6379      # Port your database instance is operating at. (Redis uses 6379 by default)
# REDIS_PASSWORD=    # (optional for unsecured instances) Password for authorisation.
```

### Step 4: Configuring language integrations

> Logos relies on third-party integrations to serve much of its language content, whether that's translations,
> definitions, or otherwise.
>
> If you'd like to set up third-party language integrations, the following steps will outline where to get each
> credential from, and what `.env` records to add to make each one work.
>
> [*If not, then that's it! You're all set.*](#thats-all)

### Step 4.1: RapidAPI

> RapidAPI is a collection of APIs that are each queryable using the same API token. Logos uses a number of integrations
> via RapidAPI.

1. Sign up / log in [here](https://rapidapi.com/auth).
2. Create an app [here](https://rapidapi.com/developer/apps/new-app). Name the app 'Logos'.
3. Subscribe to APIs:

        - [WordsAPI](https://rapidapi.com/dpventures/api/wordsapi) (free plan @ 2,500 requests per day)
4. Add a record for RapidAPI to your `.env` file:

```

### Step 4.2: DeepL

> Logos uses DeepL for providing its translation services. The free plan comes with a limit of 500,000 characters per
> month.

To get a DeepL token, you will need to have a DeepL account.

1. Sign up [here](https://deepl.com/signup).
2. Create an API key [here](https://deepl.com/your-account/keys). Name the API key 'Logos'.
3. Add a record for DeepL to your `.env` file:

```
SECRET_DEEPL=<token goes here>
```

### Step 4.3: Wordnik

> Logos uses Wordnik to provide information about words in English. The free plan comes with a limit of 100 calls per
> hour.

To get a Wordnik token, you will need to have a Wordnik account, and then request an API key.

1. Sign up [here](https://wordnik.com/signup).
2. Request an API key. The token will take a few days to arrive. You can speed up the process by donating.
3. Add a record for Wordnik to your `.env` file:

```
SECRET_WORDNIK=<token goes here>
```

<!-- 
The following dictionary has an integration that was implemented on the word overhaul branch, but which isn't present
in the main branch yet. I'll be leaving its setup entry out here for when it're added.
--->

<!--
### Step 4.4: PONS

> Logos uses PONS for its word services in several languages. The free plan comes with a limit of 1000 reference queries per month.

To get a PONS token, you will need to have a PONS account, and then submit an API registration form.

1. Sign up [here](https://account.pons.com/en/public/signup)
2. Submit an API registration form [here]().
3. Add a record for PONS to your `.env` file:
```
SECRET_PONS=<token goes here>
```
--->

### That's all!

Hopefully, once you've reached this section, you would have a fully configured instance of Logos to run for yourself.

If that's the case, congratulations, and welcome to the world of Logos!
